Upon removal of a derelect property, the derelect player's house and all blocks and chested valuables inside of it should be stored in a seperate location as determined by the Executive Council. The Executive Council shall decide if that player's goods can be given back to the player upon return in the future or claimed by the government after a reasonable amount of time. 

### Purchase Of Plots

##### Purchase Of A Resident/Citizen Plot

Citizens who work out an agreement with another citizen/resident to purchase a section or entirety of the plot may do so if the Citizen purchasing does not own a secondary plot already.
