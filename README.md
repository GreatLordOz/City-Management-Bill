# City Management Bill
Rights for the Plot Manager, Purchase of Plots and Plot Ownership in Aquila

### Plot Manager

The Plot Manager shall be defined as a citizen(s) chosen by a 2/3 vote of the Executive Council who has the power to determine new plot boundaries, give players plots and derelict houses within Aquila. The Plot Manager can be replaced following their resignation or impeachment by a 2/3 vote of the Executive Council. 

##### New Friend

For the purpose of this bill, a new friend shall be defined as any player that has joined the server for the first time and has not played a civ server previously.

### Plot Manager's Powers

##### Plot Boundaries

The plot manager shall be given the right to designate new plot boundaries within specified areas, as determined by any Executive Councilor. Plots may not contain more than 200 square meters within and including their set boundaries. Should any Executive Councilor find a problem with a plot's boundaries, they can adjust them accordingly. 

##### Plot Delegation

Upon spawning in Aquila, it is required that this new friend complete the tutorials located in the Aquila Tutorial Center. Upon completion, the Plot Manager, or Executive Councilor can designate a new plot for the new friend. Additionally, Citizens may give plots to new friends that have completed the tutorial center if the boundaries of a plot have already been determined by any Executive Councilor or Plot Manager. For interested residents who spawned outside of Aquila, they are encouraged to first complete the tutorial center, but it is not mandatory. 

##### Derelicting Property

The plot manager will have the power to derelict property within city walls in Aquila. The plot manager must first give a warning message for dereliction in discord, pinging the affected resident/citizen if applicable. A sign must be placed on the plot stating the reason for dereliction and a proposed date at least two weeks in the future before removal takes place. Upon removal of a derelict property, the derelict player's house and all blocks and chested valuables inside of it should be stored in a separate location as determined by the Executive Council. The assigned storage location will be chosen with a 2/3 vote by the Executive Council for all item storage. Failure to store a derelicted player's goods will be considered major or minor theft as outlined by the Criminal Code. 

### Purchase Of Plots

##### Unclaimed Plots

Citizens in Aquila may purchase a new plot in the city if their first plot is completed and is aesthetically well built. The Plot Manager has the power to negotiate a price for purchase with the interested citizen but must first request final approval to sell the plot from any Executive Councilor. Citizens may purchase a secondary plot totaling no more than 200 square meters within and including its boundaries. Citizens may also purchase a "Scenery" plot, which should total no more than 64 square meters within and including its boundaries. This Scenery plot should not be used as an extension to any existing plot. It should be used for greenery or a small structure to liven the area up. 

##### Purchase Of A Resident/Citizen Plot

Citizens who wish to purchase a section or entirety of a plot from another citizen/resident may do so if the Citizen purchasing does not own a Secondary plot or Scenery plot. This Secondary plot must follow the boundary guidelines stated above. The purchased plot may not count as a Scenery plot if it is part of a house or is larger than the above stated measurements. If a Citizen is renting out space in another citizen/resident's plot and that plot should be named derelict, the government does not have to pay compensation to the renter as the owner of the plot is the citizen/resident renting it.
